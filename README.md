# Cardiovascular-Prediction
Cardiovascular prediction is a challenging but incredibly important area of research that has the potential to improve public health and save lives.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. However, early detection and prevention of CVD can significantly improve outcomes and save lives. This cardiovascular prediction data science project aims to develop a predictive model such as logistic regression, decision trees, or deep learning that can identify individuals at high risk of developing CVD and help healthcare professionals intervene early.
